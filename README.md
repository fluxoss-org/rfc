# RFC - Flux

**Federated Logical Unit Exchange // Semantic Version Control for the AI Era**

Request for Comments documents exploring a new paradigm for version control optimized for AI-accelerated development.

## Purpose

This directory contains RFC documents proposing a compositional source control architecture designed to handle the unique challenges of AI-assisted development, where massive codebase changes can occur rapidly and traditional merge conflict resolution becomes inadequate.

10. [**010-Implementation-Strategy**](010-Implementation-Strategy.md) - Development roadmap and migration strategy

## Overview

These RFCs propose a fundamental shift from traditional VCS models to a system that:

- Uses compositional change tracking instead of file-level diffs
- Employs AI for semantic understanding of code changes
- Implements event sourcing for complete change history
- Provides intelligent conflict resolution through machine learning
- Optimizes for rapid, large-scale codebase transformations
